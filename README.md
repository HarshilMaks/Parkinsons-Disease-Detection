# Parkinson's Disease Detection using Machine Learning

## Overview
Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement and speech. This project focuses on building a machine learning model to detect Parkinson's disease using diagnostic data, aiming to assist in early diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

---

## Features
- Data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- Implementation of supervised machine learning algorithms (e.g., Support Vector Machine, Random Forest).
- Model evaluation using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualization of key results and insights.
